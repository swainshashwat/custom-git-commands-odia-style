# Custom odia style git commands!

Basically a drunken conversation escalated too far. This is a fun spoof of git commands, we had to do owing to terrible boredom.

git clone https://github.com/swainshashwat/custom-git-commands-odia-style
cd custom-git-commands-odia-style
source .custom_alias_git_alias
mausa
```
# Or
```
./desigit.sh
```
# Example Commands
